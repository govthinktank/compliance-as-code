The traditional compliance process is:

* Reactive: A response to rules and regulations.
* Manual: A security plan can be hundreds of pages.
* Labor intensive: A security plan can be hundreds of pages.
* Time-consuming: It takes a year (around 543 hours) or more to get an ATO.
* Expensive: Estimated costs range from $180-700K average annual.
* Misleading: It doesnâ€™t necessarily make systems more secure.

From [NIST](https://pages.nist.gov/OSCAL/learnmore/):

> There are a number of complicating factors contributing to the challenges faced by information system security professionals today.
> 
> * Multiple regulatory standards and frameworks, which change over time;
> * Regulatory standards and frameworks overlap in scope and can often conflict or be difficult to manage together; and
> * Information systems are increasing in size and complexity.
