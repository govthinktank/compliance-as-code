Compliance as code is an automated testing process that ensures security-related rules and regulations are being continuously followed.

From [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2019/08/19/get-started-compliance-as-code/):

> “Compliance as code methods ensure that the correct regulatory or company compliance requirements are fulfilled with zero-touch on the path to production. It builds compliance into development and operations.”

From [BMC](https://www.bmc.com/blogs/it-security-vs-it-compliance-whats-the-difference/):

> “While compliance is similar to security in that it drives a business to practice due diligence in the protection of its digital assets, the motive behind compliance is different: It is centered around the requirements of a third party, such as a government, security framework, or client’s contractual terms.”

From [O’Reilly](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/devopssec/9781491971413/ch05.html): 

> “building compliance into development and operations, and wiring compliance policies and checks and auditing into Continuous Delivery so that regulatory compliance becomes an integral part of how DevOps teams work on a day-to-day basis”
