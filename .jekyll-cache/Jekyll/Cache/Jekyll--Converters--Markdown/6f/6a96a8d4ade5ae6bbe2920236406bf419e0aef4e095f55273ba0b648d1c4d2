<p>From <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2019/08/19/get-started-compliance-as-code/">GitLab</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Compliance as code methods ensure that the correct regulatory or company compliance requirements are fulfilled with zero-touch on the path to production. It builds compliance into development and operations.”</p>

<p>From <a href="https://www.bmc.com/blogs/it-security-vs-it-compliance-whats-the-difference/">BMC</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“While compliance is similar to security in that it drives a business to practice due diligence in the protection of its digital assets, the motive behind compliance is different: It is centered around the requirements of a third party, such as a government, security framework, or client’s contractual terms.”</p>
